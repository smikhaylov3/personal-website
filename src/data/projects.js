      role: 'I created this application from the Apple Developers site for beginning to learn Swift 3.  Much of the tutorial is still outdated for Swift 2 and needed much more research on how to upgrade to the newer version of Swift.  The GitHub and the application reflects the updated code and is a useful project to refer to when stuck with the old tutorial.  My next steps are to build upon this project to include dates of consumption, being able to take a picture while in the app to save as an entry, and add a location.  Other thoughts of consideration are to create another site with an updated tutorial for the same application but with Swift 3 for newcomers to easily learn the development process on XCode.',
